A Text Summarization Tool is a software application or algorithm designed to automatically condense large volumes of text into shorter, meaningful summaries. It identifies the most important information in the source text while preserving its core meaning and intent. Summarization can be:

Extractive: Selects and combines key sentences or phrases from the original text.

Abstractive: Generates new sentences that convey the essence of the text, often rephrasing or paraphrasing.

These tools are widely used in applications such as news aggregation, academic research, customer service, and business intelligence to save time and enhance information processing.
